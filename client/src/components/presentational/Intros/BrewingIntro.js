That is why, for each coffee, we provide guidance on how best to brew it; a step-by-step guide developed from countless cupping sessions and iterations.\n\nWe feel it is also important to understand why or how different extraction methods highlight different flavor notes in a coffee. A better understanding of the variables at play allows all coffee drinkers to make more informed choices about their roasts, coffees etc.\n\nWe believe weâ€™ve done a good job if you, the customer, are curious enough to explore extraction methods different from your usual one!`}
